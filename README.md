# Global Layoffs Analysis: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


## Overview

This project demonstrates a rigorous "Data-First" approach to cleaning and analyzing a modern dataset of global workforce layoffs using MySQL. The workflow prioritizes data integrity through the use of Staging Tables and Window Functions to identify and remove duplicates, followed by an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to track rolling totals of layoffs across different funding stages and industries. The project culminates in a Tableau dashboard that provides a geospatial and temporal map of economic shifts within the tech sector.
